## 🎯 Current Task:
- Implementing EJS template system via GitHub Codespaces
- Fixed package.json syntax error
- Creating views directory structure and EJS files
- Running conversion scripts to preserve HTML content

## ✅ Completed Today:
- Fixed package.json comma error (line 19, column 5)
- Created clean package.json with all dependencies
- Successfully installed ejs and express-ejs-layouts
- Created test-ejs-setup.js for basic file structure
- Identified missing views/layouts/main.ejs issue

## 🔄 In Progress:
- Running test-ejs-setup.js to create basic structure
- Converting HTML files to EJS templates
- Setting up views directory (layouts, partials, pages)
- Testing server.js with EJS configuration

## ❌ Still Need:
- Complete HTML to EJS conversion for all 13 pages
- Update server.js routes to use res.render()
- Test all pages render correctly
- Verify navigation updates work across all pages
- Add camera data to database
- Implement feature improvements

## 🐛 Active Issues:
- auto-convert-to-ejs.js exists but views folder not created
- ENOENT error for views/layouts/main.ejs
- Need to run test-ejs-setup.js to create structure

## 📁 Files Changed:
- package.json - fixed and cleaned (new version)
- package.json.broken - backup of broken file
- auto-convert-to-ejs.js - created (needs debugging)
- test-ejs-setup.js - created for simple setup
- views/ directory - pending creation

## 💡 Next Session:
Start with: Complete EJS setup and test navigation updates

## 🚀 New Ideas to Explore:
- Add camera comparison tool (mentioned 11/14)
- Bulk upload for multiple cameras
- API endpoint for developers
- Auto-detect camera from uploaded image
- Price history tracking
- Camera Timeline feature
- User authentication system

- **One-click navigation updates (implementing now!)**
- **Component-based architecture (in progress)**
- **Admin panel for easy content management**
- **Auto-save draft features**

## 🏗️ Architecture Status:
- Total Files: 24 + pending EJS files
- Using GitHub Codespaces for implementation
- EJS Template System: 50% COMPLETE
- Navigation Management: Converting from 13 files → 1 file
- Package Dependencies: FIXED ✅
- Views Structure: PENDING CREATION 🚧

# PROJECT STATUS - Camera Manual Vault

## Last Updated: November 15, 2024, 2:20 PM PST

## 🎯 Current Task:
- Debug why structure files aren't being generated/pushed to cmv-structure
- Structure repo only contains README.md instead of expected files

## ✅ Completed Today:
- Implemented complete automated structure system
- Created all necessary files and repositories
- Enabled GitHub Actions permissions
- Workflow runs successfully without errors
- Confirmed cmv-structure repo exists with README.md

## 🔄 In Progress:
- Debugging why structure files aren't being generated
- Need to check workflow logs for file generation output

## ❌ Still Need:
- Get these files to appear in cmv-structure:
  - STRUCTURE.json
  - FILE_MAP.md
  - CSS_GUIDE.md
  - API_ROUTES.md
  - QUICK_REFERENCE.md
  - PROJECT_STATUS.md
- Verify full automation cycle works

## 🐛 Active Issues:
- Structure files not being generated or pushed
- Only README.md exists in cmv-structure repo
- Original issue: Main repo at 66% capacity (solution ready but not working)

## 📁 Files Changed:
- scripts/generate-structure.js (created)
- .github/workflows/update-structure.yml (created)
- CLAUDE_AUTOMATION.md (updated)
- public/css/main.css (added markers)

## 💡 Next Session:
Start with: Add console.log statements to workflow to debug file generation

## 🚀 New Ideas to Explore:
- Add camera comparison tool (mentioned 11/14)
- Bulk upload for multiple cameras (discussed as future feature)
- API endpoint for developers (user expressed interest)
- Auto-detect camera from uploaded image (cool but complex)
- Price history tracking (would help users)
- Add "Camera Timeline" showing evolution of each brand's cameras
- Implement camera comparison tool (select 2-3 cameras side by side)
- Add user authentication for saving favorite cameras
- Create API for developers to access camera database
- Add price tracking to show historical prices
- Import cameras from CSV for bulk additions
- Add "Similar Cameras" recommendation engine
- Create mobile app version
- Add user reviews/ratings for cameras
- Integrate with YouTube for camera review videos

## 🏗️ Architecture Status:
- Total Files: 37
- Total Directories: 5
- Total Lines of Code: 9,465+
- Main File Types: .html (12), .md (5), .js (3), .json (2), .yml (2)
- API Routes: 14+
- Database Tables: 2
- CSS Classes: 47+
- Structure System: PARTIALLY WORKING (workflow runs but files not generated)

## 📝 Important Notes:
- Workflow completes but structure files aren't appearing
- Need to add debugging to see what's happening
- May need to check Node.js execution in workflow

## 🔧 Quick Fix to Try:

Add debugging steps to the workflow:

```yaml
- name: Generate structure
  run: |
    cd main-repo
    echo "Current directory: $(pwd)"
    echo "Files before generation:"
    ls -la ../structure-repo
    node scripts/generate-structure.js ../structure-repo
    echo "Files after generation:"
    ls -la ../structure-repo

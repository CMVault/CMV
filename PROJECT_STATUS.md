# PROJECT STATUS - Camera Manual Vault

## Last Updated: November 15, 2024, 10:50 PM PST

## 🎯 Current Task:
- COMPLETED: Updated cameras.html to dark theme ✅
- COMPLETED: Updated camera-finder.html to dark theme ✅
- Next: Create placeholder.jpg image and test site functionality

## ✅ Completed Today:
- Set up GitHub Actions scraper (runs every 6 hours)
- Fixed scraper permissions and workflow
- Created data folder with test camera data
- Scraper now successfully creates and commits files
- Decided to finish site before adding real scraping
- **Updated cameras.html to professional dark theme**
- **Updated camera-finder.html to professional dark theme**
- **Verified server.js has camera route (it does!)**

## 🔄 In Progress:
- Testing camera detail pages (route exists, should work)
- Creating placeholder.jpg image

## ❌ Still Need:
- Create placeholder.jpg image file
- Build missing pages (productions, forum, blog, compare, quiz)
- Add real scraper files (ultimate-scraper.js) - waiting until site is ready
- User authentication system
- Email notifications
- Admin dashboard
- More cameras in database (currently only Canon R5 test data)

## 🐛 Active Issues:
- Camera detail pages may still return 404 (need to test - route exists)
- Some navigation links go to non-existent pages
- Scraper runs but only creates test data (intentional for now)
- Need placeholder.jpg in public/images/

## 📁 Files Changed:
- Created .github/workflows/scraper.yml (working!)
- Created data/cameras.json with test camera
- Created data/camera-vault.db
- Updated cameras.html to dark theme
- Updated camera-finder.html to dark theme
- Updated PROJECT_STATUS.md

## 💡 Next Session:
Start with: Testing the site functionality and creating placeholder.jpg

# PROJECT STATUS - Camera Manual Vault

## Last Updated: November 15, 2024, 3:30 PM PST

## 🎯 Current Task:
- Update cameras.html to dark theme
- Update camera-finder.html to dark theme
- Fix server.js camera route for detail pages

## ✅ Completed Today:
- Set up GitHub Actions scraper (runs every 6 hours)
- Fixed scraper permissions and workflow
- Created data folder with test camera data
- Scraper now successfully creates and commits files
- Decided to finish site before adding real scraping

## 🔄 In Progress:
- Converting cameras.html to dark theme
- Converting camera-finder.html to dark theme
- Adding /camera/:id route to server.js

## ❌ Still Need:
- Update cameras.html and camera-finder.html to dark theme
- Fix server.js route for camera detail pages
- Create placeholder.jpg image (skipped for now)
- Build missing pages (productions, forum, blog, compare, quiz)
- Add real scraper files (ultimate-scraper.js) - waiting until site is ready
- User authentication system
- Email notifications
- Admin dashboard

## 🐛 Active Issues:
- Camera detail pages return 404 (missing route in server.js)
- Two pages still using light theme (cameras.html, camera-finder.html)
- Some navigation links go to non-existent pages
- Scraper runs but only creates test data (intentional for now)

## 📁 Files Changed:
- Created .github/workflows/scraper.yml (working!)
- Created data/cameras.json with test camera
- Created data/camera-vault.db
- Updated PROJECT_STATUS.md

## 💡 Next Session:
Start with: "start cmv automation" and update cameras.html to dark theme

## 🚀 New Ideas to Explore:
- Auto-scraping system running 24/7 via GitHub Actions (ready, just needs scraper files)
- AI camera identification from images
- User authentication and profiles
- Camera comparison tool
- Price history tracking
- Manual PDF text extraction
- API for developers
- Mobile app version
- Forum with user discussions
- Production database (which movies used which cameras)
- Rental price tracking
- Virtual camera museum with 3D models
- Equipment insurance calculator
- Photographer portfolio integration
- Camera timeline visualization
- YouTube review integration
- Social features (likes, saves, comments)
- Camera recommendation quiz
- Gear marketplace integration
- Photography course recommendations
- Camera repair shop directory
- Firmware update tracker
- Used camera price guide

## 📝 Important Notes:
- GitHub Actions scraper is WORKING - runs every 6 hours
- Currently only creates test data (Canon R5) to avoid clutter
- Will add real scraper after site is complete
- Dark theme needs to be applied to cameras.html and camera-finder.html
- Server route for camera details still needs to be added
- All pages should use dark theme for consistency

## 🤖 Automation System

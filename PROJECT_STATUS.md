# PROJECT STATUS - Camera Manual Vault

## Last Updated: November 15, 2024, 1:00 PM PST

## 🎯 Current Task:
- Debug why structure generation workflow failed
- Get cmv-structure repository to populate

## ✅ Completed Today:
- Implemented complete automated structure system
- Created all necessary files and repositories
- Enabled GitHub Actions permissions
- Ran first test (failed - needs debugging)

## 🔄 In Progress:
- Debugging workflow failure
- Getting first successful structure generation

## ❌ Still Need:
- Fix workflow issues
- Verify structure repo populates
- Test that PROJECT_STATUS.md auto-updates

## 🐛 Active Issues:
- GitHub workflow not generating structure files
- cmv-structure repo remains empty
- Original issue: Main repo at 66% capacity (solution ready but not working yet)

## 📁 Files Changed:
- scripts/generate-structure.js (created)
- .github/workflows/update-structure.yml (created)
- CLAUDE_AUTOMATION.md (updated)
- public/css/main.css (added markers)

## 💡 Next Session:
Start with: Check workflow logs at https://github.com/CMVault/cmv/actions

## 🚀 New Ideas to Explore:
- Add camera comparison tool (mentioned 11/14)
- Bulk upload for multiple cameras (discussed as future feature)
- API endpoint for developers (user expressed interest)
- Auto-detect camera from uploaded image (cool but complex)
- Price history tracking (would help users)
- Add "Camera Timeline" showing evolution of each brand's cameras
- Implement camera comparison tool (select 2-3 cameras side by side)
- Add user authentication for saving favorite cameras
- Create API for developers to access camera database
- Add price tracking to show historical prices
- Import cameras from CSV for bulk additions
- Add "Similar Cameras" recommendation engine
- Create mobile app version
- Add user reviews/ratings for cameras
- Integrate with YouTube for camera review videos

## 🏗️ Architecture Status:
- Structure System: IMPLEMENTED BUT NOT WORKING
- Current Repo Size: 66% of Claude capacity
- Structure Repo: Created but empty
- Automation: Deployed but failing
- CSS Markers: Added ✅
- All Files: Created ✅
- Permissions: Enabled ✅
- First Run: Failed ❌

## 📝 Important Notes:
- Structure automation is fully built but needs debugging
- Likely issues: npm dependencies, file paths, or git permissions
- Solution will reduce repo viewing from 66% to <1% once working
- Check GitHub Actions logs for specific error messages

## 🔧 Implementation Progress:
1. ✅ Create cmv-structure repository (DONE)
2. ✅ Add generate-structure.js to main repo (DONE)
3. ✅ Create GitHub workflow (DONE)
4. ✅ Update CLAUDE_AUTOMATION.md (DONE)
5. ✅ Add CSS section markers (DONE)
6. ✅ Enable GitHub Actions permissions (DONE)
7. ✅ Test run attempted (FAILED)
8. ❌ Debug and fix workflow
9. ❌ Verify automation works

## 🐞 Debugging Checklist:
- [ ] Check workflow logs for error messages
- [ ] Verify Node.js version compatibility
- [ ] Check if npm install is needed in workflow
- [ ] Verify file paths are correct
- [ ] Check git permissions between repositories
- [ ] Test generate-structure.js locally
- [ ] Verify GitHub token has correct permissions

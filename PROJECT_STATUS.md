- Enabling auto-update of structure repository on push

## ✅ Completed Today:
- Fixed generate-structure.js by removing unnecessary module imports
- Structure generation script is now deployment-ready

- Setting up continuous scraper schedule

## ❌ Still Need:
- Create .github/workflows/update-structure.yml
- Create .github/workflows/scraper.yml
- Test GitHub Actions trigger on push
- Configure repository secrets if needed

## 🐛 Active Issues:
- GitHub workflows directory missing from repository

## 📁 Files Changed:
- None yet - need to add .github/workflows directory

## 💡 Next Session:
Start with: Test push to verify GitHub Actions trigger and structure auto-update

## 🚀 New Ideas to Explore:
- Add camera comparison tool (mentioned 11/14)
- Bulk upload for multiple cameras (discussed as future feature)
- API endpoint for developers (user expressed interest)
- Auto-detect camera from uploaded image (cool but complex)
- Price history tracking (would help users)
- Add "Camera Timeline" showing evolution of each brand's cameras
- Implement camera comparison tool (select 2-3 cameras side by side)
- Add user authentication for saving favorite cameras
- Create API for developers to access camera database
- Add price tracking to show historical prices
- Import cameras from CSV for bulk additions
- Add "Similar Cameras" recommendation engine
- Create mobile app version
- Add user reviews/ratings for cameras
- Integrate with YouTube for camera review videos
- Add manual PDF viewer directly in browser
- Create camera comparison matrix export feature
- Add GitHub Pages deployment for static docs

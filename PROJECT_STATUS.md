## 🔧 REMAINING UPDATES NEEDED:

### 1. Update Navigation on Other Pages
Remove "Search" link and change "Forum" to "Camera Blog" in:

#### For index.html:
```html
<!-- Find this navigation -->
<li><a href="/forum">Forum</a></li>
<li><a href="/search">Search</a></li>

<!-- Replace with -->
<li><a href="/camera-blog">Camera Blog</a></li>
```

#### For camera-detail.html:
```html
<!-- Find this navigation -->
<li><a href="/forum">Forum</a></li>
<li><a href="/search">Search</a></li>

<!-- Replace with -->
<li><a href="/camera-blog">Camera Blog</a></li>
```

#### For camera-finder.html:
```html
<!-- Find this navigation -->
<li><a href="/forum">Forum</a></li>
<li><a href="/search">Search</a></li>

<!-- Replace with -->
<li><a href="/camera-blog">Camera Blog</a></li>
```

### 2. Update server.js
Add this route for Camera Blog:
```javascript
// Add this with your other routes
app.get('/camera-blog', (req, res) => {
    res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, 'public', 'camera-blog.html'));
});

// Also add routes for legal pages when you create them
app.get('/privacy', (req, res) => res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, 'public', 'privacy.html')));
app.get('/terms', (req, res) => res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, 'public', 'terms.html')));
app.get('/dmca', (req, res) => res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, 'public', 'dmca.html')));
app.get('/attribution', (req, res) => res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, 'public', 'attribution.html')));
app.get('/legal', (req, res) => res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, 'public', 'legal.html')));
```

### 3. Delete search.html
- Go to: https://github.com/CMVault/cmv/blob/main/public/search.html
- Click the trash icon to delete
- Commit message: "Remove generic search page - using section-specific searches"

### 4. Files to Update:
- **index.html**: Update navigation
- **camera-detail.html**: Update navigation  
- **camera-finder.html**: Update navigation
- **server.js**: Add camera-blog route and legal page routes

## 📊 Search System Architecture:
- **Cameras Section**: Searches only cameras, brands, camera features
- **Camera Blog**: Searches only articles, authors, topics
- **Productions** (future): Will search only films, shows, productions
- **No Cross-Contamination**: Each section's search is isolated
- **Smart Suggestions**: Context-aware based on current section

## 🎯 Next Immediate Steps:
1. Update navigation on 3 remaining HTML pages
2. Add camera-blog route to server.js
3. Delete search.html

5. Start creating legal pages

The site architecture is now much cleaner with dedicated search functionality for each major section!

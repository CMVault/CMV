- Implement camera comparison tool (select 2-3 cameras side by side)
- Add user authentication for saving favorite cameras
- Create API for developers to access camera database
- Add price tracking to show historical prices
- Import cameras from CSV for bulk additions
- Add "Similar Cameras" recommendation engine
- Create mobile app version
- Add user reviews/ratings for cameras
- Integrate with YouTube for camera review videos

## 🔧 Structure System Details:
Expected files in cmv-structure repo after automation:
- STRUCTURE.json (complete file tree with metadata)
- FILE_MAP.md (human-readable project map)
- CSS_GUIDE.md (CSS sections with line numbers)
- API_ROUTES.md (all endpoints documented)
- QUICK_REFERENCE.md (key info at a glance)
- PROJECT_STATUS.md (auto-updated status)

## 📝 Important Notes:
- Structure generation now uses only fs, path, and child_process modules
- GitHub Actions should trigger on every push to main branch
- Structure repo designed to stay under 1% capacity
- All changes tracked automatically with timestamps
- System ready for production use once verified

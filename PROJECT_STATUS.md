# PROJECT STATUS - Camera Manual Vault

## Last Updated: August 4, 2025 at 6:45 PM PST

## 🎯 Current Task:
- ✅ Ran diagnostic: Found 23 cameras total (not 48 as expected)
- ✅ 22/23 cameras already have images with valid paths
- ✅ Only 1 camera needed update: Hasselblad 500C/M
- ✅ Successfully created hasselblad-500c-m.jpg
- 🔄 Need to investigate why only 23 cameras vs expected 48
- 🔄 Need to check if current images are placeholders or real

## ✅ Completed Today:
- **Image System Success**:
  - Diagnostic revealed 22/23 cameras already have images
  - All 22 existing image files confirmed present
  - Successfully updated Hasselblad 500C/M with branded image
  - Fixed special character handling (/ → -)
  - Attribution system working

- **Database Schema Discovery**:
  - Found correct image columns: `localImagePath`, `imageUrl`, `imageAttribution`
  - Database uses 164 columns with specific naming convention
  - Column 143: `localImagePath` (not `imageLocal`)
  - Column 142: `imageUrl` 
  - Column 147: `imageAttribution`

- **Scripts Created**:
  - `update-camera-images.js` - Updates missing images
  - `check-image-status.js` - Diagnostic tool
  - `real-image-scraper.js` - For future real images
  - `cmv-automation-real-images.js` - Enhanced automation

- **Previous Achievements**:
  - Fixed camera display issues
